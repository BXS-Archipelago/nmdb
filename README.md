===== - Introduction - ====

Overview

This website is for any contemporary music enthusiast and will provide them with direct links to singer-songwriters of the Nordic Music industry.

Why does it exist

There are many artists in the Nordic region who create their music in the English language, however the marketing strategies of their record labels often do not extend properly into the global market. This website will act as a relay for the artists to introduce their music to a wider audience, especially in Europe and the US.

What does it do?

The site will provide some biographical information for each artist, with links to their work provided through YouTube and spotify links, and also direct links to the artists' social media pages.

How does it work?

The landing page will contain a gallery that will in turn open to the individual artist's page on the site.

Who will benefit most from visiting the site

Music enthusiasts.
English speaking
Commuters
Students
Anybody who uses earphones with their mobile devices
Music is proven to improve mood, reduce stress and/or anxiety, improves exercise and performance, improves memory and cognition. The people who will benefit most from this website are those with a heartbeat.

===== - User Experience - ====

Visitors to the site are looking for new music experiences from unfamiliar artists. They will be invited to browse each artist and listen to samples of the music on spotify or watch YouTube videos.

Alternatively, they can listen to a Spotify playlist without reading the page.

There are countless websites for music and artists out there, but few if any exist that compile an active list of Nordic performers. The site will initially contain contemporary female artists of the past three decades, but will expand to include male singers and also groups.

With the scope for so many artists, the site must remain easy to navigate. Other sites can be a compendium of categories and sub-categories with separate blogs and ancillary pages. This site will be: - Easy to understand - simple navigation - simple external links to open separately - unobtrusive advertising (at a later stage). - Subtle effects for site elements

The site owner actively populates the social media pages with new entries so the visitors will be encouraged to click to their favourite site, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. ===== - Wireframe Mock-site - ====

A Wireframe mock-up has been created with Balsamiq to show an approximate visual objective for the site.

Desktop

Each page will contain a logo in the top left screen that will also provide a home link to index.html.

A responsive navigation menu will sit to the top right of the screen.

Logo and navigation menu will be contained in a row with a 4 and 8 unit column width therein.

Each page will contain a footer that will house only the site's associated Social Media links.

The pages' background image will be a neutral image of a textured blue surface.

Landing page - index.html - will contain a live-music theme image with a jumbotron for text header and information.

Artists page - artists.html - will contain the main gallery of artists. The gallery will be three columns wide and will extend down the page.

The About page will give a brief for the purpose of the site with a second section for a brief on the artists featured. There will also be an image of a globe with the Nordic region highlighted.

The Contact page will contain an online form where the visitor can submit their name, email address, their country and a short message to the site owner.

Both the About and Contact page will encourage the visitor to send in the name of their favourite artist or somebody not already featured on the site.

The pages for the artists will contain a short biographical note, a section for recommendations of their work to the visitor, with link to spotify and a featured Youtube video from the artist.

Tablet View

The tablet view will inherit most features of the desktop site but the navigation bar will respond by transforming into a Burger bar for a drop-down menu. This will feature in the top right.

The Burger bar, when activated will transform into a "X" that can close the menu if required. This will be seated near the top right of the page.

Mobile view

On mobile phone devices, the nav bar will remain as an active Burger-style drop-down menu.

The Landing page gallery will shrink to a single column to scroll downwards.

==== - building the site - ====

The Navigation bar:

The initial step was to use Row/Col for the logo and navigation bar area. This produced other issues with overall page margins and padding, so I removed that layout from the header.

Rather than use a source-code template for the Navigation, I followed a video tutorial to gain the effect I wanted. Most were using JS or else were very basic looking. I chose one that will include a rotating menu icon with transitions on the page title to add extra life to the effect.

With Font-choice for the logo and menu, line-height increased dramatically so paddings and margins were set very differently. The Hamburger icon was widened with further adjustments to the - Transform:TranslateY - settings to ensure the animated X kept a centered cross-over of the first and third bars (the middle one removed using opacity).
