# ===== - Introduction - ====

## === Overview-====

This website is for any contemporary music enthusiast and will provide them with direct links to singer-songwriters of the Nordic Music industry.

### Why does it exist

There are many artists in the Nordic region who create their music in the English language, however the marketing strategies of their record labels often do not extend properly into the global market. This website will act as a relay for the artists to introduce their music to a wider audience, especially in Europe and the US.

### What does it do?

The site will provide some biographical information for each artist, with links to their work provided through YouTube and spotify links, and also direct links to the artists' social media pages.

### How does it work?

The landing page will contain a gallery that will in turn open to the individual artist's page on the site.

### How does it work?
Who will benefit most from visiting the site

Music enthusiasts.
English speaking
Commuters
Students
Anybody who uses earphones with their mobile devices
Music is proven to improve mood, reduce stress and/or anxiety, improves exercise and performance, improves memory and cognition. The people who will benefit most from this website are those with ears.

## ===== - User Experience - ====

Visitors to the site are looking for new music experiences from unfamiliar artists. They will be invited to browse each artist and listen to samples of the music on spotify or watch YouTube videos.

There are links to the artist's live shows and also icon-identifiers for their social media pages. 

Alternatively, they can listen to a Spotify playlist from the gallery without entering and reading the page.

There are countless websites for music and artists out there, but few if any exist that compile an active list of Nordic performers. The site will initially contain contemporary female artists of the past three decades, but will expand to include male singers and also groups.

With the scope for so many artists, the site must remain easy to navigate. Other sites can be a compendium of categories and sub-categories with separate blogs and ancillary pages. This site will be: - Easy to understand - simple navigation - simple external links to open separately - Subtle effects for site elements and concise single-page biography and discography, with sample video and playlist for perusal.

The site owner actively populates the social media pages with new entries so the visitors will be encouraged to click to their favourite site, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. 


###  Wireframe Mock-site 

A Wireframe mock-up has been created with Balsamiq to show an approximate visual objective for the site and is listed in the file menu herewith.

## Viewing the Site Responsively 

#### Desktop

Each page will contain a logo in the top left screen that will also provide a home link to index.html.

A responsive navigation menu will sit to the top right of the screen on tablet and smaller screens

Logo and navigation menu will be contained in a row with a 4 and 8 unit column width therein.

Each page will contain a footer that will house the site's associated Social Media links along with a brief site-summary, listed links to the Nordic countries (at a later time, this will serve as a cross-reference index for each artist listed country by country.)

The pages' background image will be a neutral off-white colour to contrast with the elements colours and shadow effects.

Landing page - index.html -will contain a brief summary of what the site is about, along with new concert information and new album releases that are relevant to the featured artists.

Artists page - artists.html - will contain the responsive main gallery of artists. Each image is animated upon hover to slide upwards to reveal the name, brief summary. The visitor can pick to either listen to the suggested Spotify list or else click into the artist's own page for full detailed information, video, playlist link or to view their albums and concert information.

The About page will give a brief summary of two things : firstly, who the featured artists are and why we focus on them. And secondly, a paragraph for the purpose of the site. 

The Contact page will contain an online form where the visitor can submit their name, email address, their country and a short message to the site owner. 

Both the About and Contact page will encourage the visitor to send in the name of their favourite artist or somebody not already featured on the site.

The pages for the artists will contain a short biographical note, a section for recommendations of their work to the visitor, with link to spotify and a featured Youtube video from the artist.

#### Tablet View

The tablet view will inherit most features of the desktop site but the navigation bar will respond by transforming into a Burger bar for a drop-down menu. This will feature in the top right.

The Burger bar, when activated will transform into a "X" that can close the menu if required. This will be seated near the top right of the page.

#### Mobile view

On mobile phone devices, the nav bar will remain as an active Burger-style drop-down menu.

The Landing page gallery will shrink to a single column to scroll downwards.

## Building the site 

The Navigation bar:

The initial step was to use Row & Column 4 & 8 for the logo and navigation bar area. This produced other issues with overall page margins and padding, so I removed that layout from the header. 

Rather than use a source-code template for the Navigation, I followed a video tutorial to gain the effect I wanted. Most were using JS or else were very basic looking. I chose one that will include a rotating menu icon with transitions on the page title to add extra life to the effect, but using only HTML and CSS. 

With Font-choice for the logo and menu (compared to the turorial instructions), the paddings and margins needed to be set very differently. The Hamburger icon was widened with further adjustments to the - Transform:TranslateY - settings to ensure the animated X kept a centered cross-over of the first and third bars (the middle one removed using opacity).

The main body uses Container, Rows and Columns with separate sub-containers for each news section. Each section was given strong contrasting colours to make it eye-catching. 

The footer also uses Container, Rows and Columns to fit all the information. It contains site information, a list for the Nordic countries, Quick links and also the site's own Social Media links in icon-identifiers. 

The Gallery - artists.html - was a long affair. The video tutorial for the effect was originally intended for just three Cards of a long rectangular shape. I re-sized the photos to make them suitable for the container, also adjusting the size of the card. The inside card was edited to fit the shrunken picture evenly at the top with the text, divider and buttons all repositioned.
